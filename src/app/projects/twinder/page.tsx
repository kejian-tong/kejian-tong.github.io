      <h2>Highlights</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Scale:</strong> Java microservices processed ~
          <strong>500M daily requests</strong> with a Redis caching layer and
          AWS EC2 autoscaling for sustained performance.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Streaming:</strong> Kafka cluster with batch compression and
          partitioning fanned out workloads to multiple consumers, cutting
          dispatch time from <strong>200ms → 100ms</strong>.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>CQRS + Sharding:</strong> CQRS storage design accelerated
          reads/writes; a sharded MongoDB cluster delivered
          <strong> 99.98% uptime</strong> with seamless scale under peak load.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Perf testing:</strong> Multi‑threaded clients and JMeter drove
          <strong>2M</strong> requests to benchmark improvements: throughput
          <strong>2k → 6.6k req/s</strong>, latency{" "}
          <strong>200ms → 30ms</strong>.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Architecture</h2>
      <p>
        The system ingests swipe events at high volume, emitting them to Kafka
        topics. A set of workers transforms events, updating projections and
        pushing match candidates into Redis. RabbitMQ is used for targeted
        fan‑out to user‑specific queues for real‑time updates.
      </p>
